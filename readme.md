Pick a set of texts.  At least 100 should be good. There should also be at least 10 different authors, but try to keep the texts related (either all on the same topic of from the same branch of literature - something to make classification a bit more difficult than obviously different subjects).

Create a series of clusters. Try several techniques and pick the one you think best represents your data. Make sure there is a narrative and reasoning around why you have chosen the given clusters. Are authors consistently grouped into the same cluster?

Perform some unsupervised feature generation and selection.  Using those features then build models to attempt to classify your texts by author. Try different permutations of unsupervised and supervised techniques to see which combinations have the best performance.

Return to holdout group: 
- Does your clustering on those members perform as you'd expect? 
- Have your clusters remained stable or changed dramatically? What about your model? 
- Is it's performance consistent?

If there is a divergence in the relative stability of your model and your clusters, delve into why.

Write up: 
- How clustering and modeling compare for classifying your texts. 
- What are the advantages of each? 
- Why would you want to use one over the other?
